We're pleased to have you take a look at our new website. It combines both the main landing site and the documentation
all in one neat package. The website is using a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme called [Doks](https://getdoks.org/).

This does change the development process for documentation slightly compared to what it was previously. However most of
the changes will make it easier for most documentation contributors.

As part of this redesign we've taken the time to rewrite and reorganize key sections of the documentation. This may
result in some links not working. Key things to note are the contribution documentation is up-to-date and probably more
detailed than it ever has been before.

In particular the integration documentation is far more comprehensive than it was previously and some areas of the
configuration documentation that were not really relevant for configuration have moved slightly.

You may have also noticed we launched a new blog.
