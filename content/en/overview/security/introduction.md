The **Authelia** team takes security very seriously. Because **Authelia** is intended as a security product a lot of
decisions are made with security being the priority. This section discusses these decisions as well as considerations
users should make when implementing **Authelia**.

## Coordinated vulnerability disclosure

**Authelia** follows the [coordinated vulnerability disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure)
model when dealing with security vulnerabilities. This was previously known as `responsible disclosure`. We strongly
urge anyone reporting vulnerabilities to **Authelia** or any other project to follow this model as it is considered
as a best practice by many in the security industry.
