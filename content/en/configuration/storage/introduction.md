__Authelia__ supports multiple storage backends. The backend is used to store user preferences, 2FA device handles and
secrets, authentication logs, etc...

The available storage backends are listed in the table of contents below.

## Configuration

```yaml
storage:
  encryption_key: a_very_important_secret
  local: {}
  mysql: {}
  postgres: {}
```

## Options

### encryption_key

{{< confkey type="string" required="yes" >}}

The encryption key used to encrypt data in the database. We encrypt data by creating a sha256 checksum of the provided
value, and use that to encrypt the data with the AES-GCM 256bit algorithm.

The minimum length of this key is 20 characters, however we generally recommend above 64 characters.

This secret must be generated by the administrator and can
be done by following the
[Generating a Random Alphanumeric String](../miscellaneous/guides.md#generating-a-random-alphanumeric-string)
guide.

See [securty measures](../../overview/security/measures.md#storage-security-measures) for more information.

### postgres

See [PostgreSQL](postgres.md).

### local

See [SQLite](sqlite.md).

### mysql

See [MySQL](mysql.md).
