[Envoy] is probably supported by **Authelia**.

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

It's currently not certain, but fairly likely that [Envoy] is supported by **Authelia**. We wish to add documentation
and thus if anyone has this working please let us know.

We will aim to perform documentation for this on our own but there is no current timeframe.

## Potential

Support for [Envoy] should be possible via [Envoy]'s
[external authorization](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/http/ext_authz/v3/ext_authz.proto.html#extensions-filters-http-ext-authz-v3-extauthz).
